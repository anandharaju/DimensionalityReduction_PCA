# DimensionalityReduction_PCA
Dimensionality Reduction by Feature Extraction: You create new independent features, where each new independent feature is a combination of each of the old independent features. These techniques can further be divided into linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques.  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Principal Component Analysis or PCA is a linear feature extraction technique. It performs a linear mapping of the data to a lower-dimensional space in such a way that the variance of the data in the low-dimensional representation is maximized. It does so by calculating the eigenvectors from the covariance matrix. The eigenvectors that correspond to the largest eigenvalues (the principal components) are used to reconstruct a significant fraction of the variance of the original data.  In simpler terms, PCA combines your input features in a specific way that you can drop the least important feature while still retaining the most valuable parts of all of the features. As an added benefit, each of the new features or components created after PCA are all independent of one another.
